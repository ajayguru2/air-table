# GPU Acceleration Implementation

This document outlines the GPU acceleration improvements implemented to ensure smooth UI interactions in the CSV Analyzer application.

## Overview

The application now uses hardware-accelerated rendering to provide smooth scrolling, animations, and interactions, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Tauri Configuration
- Configured window properties for optimal performance
- Added platform-specific capabilities
- Enabled proper window decorations and transparency
- Optimized window management for GPU acceleration

### 2. CSS GPU Acceleration
- Applied `transform: translateZ(0)` to force GPU layers
- Added `backface-visibility: hidden` for performance
- Used `will-change` property to hint at animations
- Optimized transitions with GPU-friendly properties
- Enhanced animations with hardware acceleration

### 3. React Component Optimizations
- Memoized VirtualizedTable component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Used `useCallback` for Row component to optimize rendering
- Added GPU acceleration styles inline for critical elements
- Optimized scroll performance with `overscanCount` and `useIsScrolling`

### 4. Performance Utilities
Created comprehensive performance utilities in `src/utils/performance.ts`:
- `enableGPUAcceleration()` - Apply GPU acceleration to elements
- `optimizeScrollPerformance()` - Optimize scroll containers
- `debounce()` and `throttle()` - Performance optimization helpers
- `FrameRateMonitor` - Monitor and debug performance
- `initializeGPUAcceleration()` - Setup GPU acceleration globally

## Performance Features

### Hardware Acceleration Detection
The application automatically detects GPU support and applies appropriate optimizations:
```typescript
if (isGPUAccelerationSupported()) {
  initializeGPUAcceleration();
}
```

### Virtual Scrolling Optimization
- GPU-accelerated scroll containers
- Optimized row rendering with hardware acceleration
- Smooth header synchronization during horizontal scrolling

### Animation Performance
- All animations use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- Smooth transitions with `cubic-bezier` easing
- Hardware-accelerated hover effects

## Browser Compatibility

The GPU acceleration features work best in modern browsers that support:
- WebGL
- CSS transforms with 3D acceleration
- Hardware-accelerated compositing

## Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring:
- FPS monitoring for debugging
- Automatic detection of low frame rates
- Console warnings for performance issues

## Usage

GPU acceleration is automatically enabled when the application starts. No additional configuration is required.

### Manual GPU Acceleration
If needed, you can manually enable GPU acceleration for specific elements:

```typescript
import { enableGPUAcceleration } from './utils/performance';

const element = document.querySelector('.my-element');
if (element) {
  enableGPUAcceleration(element);
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
To monitor frame rates during development:

```typescript
import { FrameRateMonitor } from './utils/performance';

const monitor = new FrameRateMonitor();
monitor.start();

// Check FPS
console.log('Current FPS:', monitor.getFPS());

// Stop monitoring
monitor.stop();
```

## Benefits

1. **Smooth Scrolling**: Large datasets scroll smoothly without lag
2. **Responsive UI**: Animations and transitions are fluid
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced CPU usage for rendering
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Professional feel with smooth interactions
5. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets more efficiently

## Technical Details

### CSS Properties Used
- `transform: translateZ(0)` - Forces GPU layer creation
- `backface-visibility: hidden` - Optimizes rendering
- `will-change` - Hints at upcoming animations
- `perspective: 1000px` - Enables 3D acceleration

### React Optimizations
- `React.memo()` - Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- `useCallback()` - Optimizes function references
- `useRef()` - Efficient DOM access
- Inline styles for critical performance elements

### Tauri Configuration
- Window decorations and transparency for better rendering
- Platform-specific capabilities for optimal performance
- Proper window management for GPU acceleration
- HTML meta tags for hardware acceleration hints

## Troubleshooting

If you experience performance issues:

1. Check browser console for GPU support warnings
2. Verify WebGL is enabled in your browser
3. Monitor FPS using the built-in monitor
4. Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled in your OS

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for even better performance:
- Web Workers for data processing
- WebAssembly for heavy computations
- Advanced virtualization techniques
- Progressive loading for very large datasets
